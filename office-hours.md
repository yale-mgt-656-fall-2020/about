# Office hours

The office hours for each of the teaching staff is shown
below. Though, if you are reading this at the start of
the semester, it is possible some staff are missing because
they did not yet determine their schedule.

All office hours will be held virtually in Fall 2020.

Feel free to send an email if these times do not work for you.
